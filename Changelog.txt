0.6 (Apr 04, 2008):

Features:

- Interface changes

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed unlock loader when dupe files are involved


0.5 (Jul 18, 2007):

Features:

- Completely redesigned interface

- Major cleanup and reconstruction of the code base

- Group locking. All songs in a group can be locked by changing the attributes of the
  group itself. This way, the group will not appear in StepMania until the songs in the group
  have been unlocked

- Reset function. All changes to songs and groups in a session can be reset to give the values
  from when the songs were loaded in a session

- All limits for points have been raised to 10000

Bug Fixes:

- Hard to say


0.3 (Apr 16, 2007):

Features:

- A slightly faster and more controlled recursive directory search has been implemented

- Unlock codes are written to the Unlocks.dat file and read from the Unlocks.dat file.
  A backup copy of an existing Unlocks.dat file, Unlocks.dat.backup, will be written
  prior to writing the new file

- Some light command line argument parsing has been added. The root StepMania
  directory can be specified (with -d flag) and the data in the directory will
  automatically load

- The limit for Dance Points has been set to 1000 and the limit for the
  other options is now 500 (each limit was previously set to 100)

- Added a song title box to the main GUI. I hesitated putting it on before
  but I think the dev of Stepmania Song Locker had the right idea

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed some of the parsing commands to better adhere to StepMania standards;
  primarily regarding titles and subtitles with excess whitespace

- Fixed unlock code generation for songs with Japanese titles/subtitles;
  added parsing of #TITLETRANSLIT and #SUBTITLETRANSLIT lines since they
  take precedence in unlock codes

- Fixed case-sensitive file extension lookup

- Fixed issue with buttons on the interface remaining active while a
  file search is in progress

- Fixed bug with the current working directory needing to be specified in the
  application's desktop file or bash script. The current working directory
  is now obtained within the application


0.2 (Mar 16, 2007):

Features:

- Added a Quick Song Search

- Added an About window

- Added a dialog stating the location of the written NewUnlocked.dat file

- Looks for default StepMania directory under Windows and sets searchfolder
  if the directory exists

- Song entry listings are now case-insensitive

- Multiple song entries are pruned so that only one entry of a song exists

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed bug where the first song entry on the list was ignored

- Fixed bug with readfile not being incremented when no title
  entry was found in a file

- Fixed window drawing issues that caused problems under Windows

- Fixed issues with some window widgets not getting dereference properly


0.1.5 (Mar 3, 2007):

- Released a Windows installer


0.1 (Feb 28, 2007):
